\section{Simple Production}

\textbf{Both production environments are build for Unix systems only.  This means they will not work on Windows.}

\subsection{Installation}

To install the simple production environment the following commands should be run in the root folder of the repository.  These commands require root or being a member of the 'docker' group.

\begin{minted}{bash}
	docker-compose build
	docker-compose up -d
\end{minted}

\subsection{Updating}

To update the test environment run the following commands while in the repository.  Some of these commands require root.

\begin{minted}{bash}
	git pull origin master
	docker-compose build
	docker-compose down
	docker-compose up -d
\end{minted}
