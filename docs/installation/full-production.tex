\section{Full Production}

\subsection{Installation}

Set the following environment variables.  You may want to put these into your .bashrc file so you don't have to set them each time.  Both paths should be absolute paths.

\begin{minted}{bash}
	export SSL_LOCATION="Location to host ssl certificates."
	export SOLUTIONS_FOLDER="Location to save solutions zip files to."
\end{minted}

Create the folders.

\begin{minted}{bash}
	mkdir -p $SSL_LOCATION $SOLUTIONS_FOLDER
\end{minted}

Launch the server

\begin{minted}{bash}
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml build
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
\end{minted}

TODO add SSL certificate generation.

\subsection{Updating the production environment}

To update the production environment run the following commands while in the root directory of the repository.  Some of these commands require root.

\begin{minted}{bash}
	git pull origin master
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml build
	docker-compose down
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
\end{minted}
